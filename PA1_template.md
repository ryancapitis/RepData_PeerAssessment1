## Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
#Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")

#Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
df$date <- as.Date(df$date)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```r
#histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
library(ggplot2)
total.steps.by.day <- aggregate(x = df$steps , by = list(df$date), FUN = sum ,na.rm=TRUE)
names(total.steps.by.day) <- c("date","steps")
histplot <- ggplot(total.steps.by.day,aes(x = steps)) +
            ggtitle("Histogram of daily steps") +
            xlab("Steps (binwidth 2000)") +
            geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000)
histplot
```

#median total number of steps taken per day

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```r
#Time series plot of 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days
average.steps.by.interval  <- aggregate(x = df$steps , by = list(df$interval), FUN = mean ,na.rm=TRUE)

average.steps.by.interval[which.max(average.steps.by.interval$steps),c("interval")]

## Imputing missing values

```r
#total number of missing values in the dataset
nrow(df[is.na(df$steps),])
```

```

```r
#imputing missing step values with mean step at time interval

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```r
#Factor variable with two levels indicating a weekday or weekend.
df.imputed$weekday <- as.factor(ifelse(weekdays(df.imputed$date) %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) 

average.steps.by.interval.and.weekday  <- aggregate(x = df.imputed$steps ,

#panel time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken
